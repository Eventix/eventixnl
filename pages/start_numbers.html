    <div class="subtitle">Tickets include starting numbers.</div>

    <p>We want to win at automation. That is why we automated the assigning of the starting numbers, when someone buys a ticket their ticket is automatically numbered. <br><br>

The starting number is included when an attendee buys a ticket. Easy as that.
