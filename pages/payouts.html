    </h2>
    <div class="subtitle">Enjoy a constant, flexible cash flow to your preference </div>

    <p>If we say flexible, we mean flexible. You will be able to get your payments done daily, weekly, after a certain threshold or on request! We know that a steady cash flow is significant and different events need different cash flows.<br><br>

Also, the payments made to affiliates will pay automatically. This way payments will be made fair and quickly, as we have always done.
