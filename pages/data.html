    <p>Data is becoming more important every day. That is why we optimised all our tools to gather data you can use to improve your event. You can also add your questions to the ticket buying ritual. Therefore, you can enhance your event in any way you would like.<br><br>

When someone logs in with their Facebook account to buy a ticket, we automatically gather the information from their Facebook. Therefore, we make the bond between you and your visitor more personal.<br><br>

The choice is up to you. We have many questions you can ask before someone can buy a ticket. However, you can also add your questions or leave them out.<br><br>

They are your visitors, get to know them.
