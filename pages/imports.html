    <p>We want all your visitors to have a smooth experience. But since you have taken particular interest for the people on your guest list, so will we. If you upload your guest list, we will make sure they get the tickets.<br><br> 

This way there wonâ€™t be any problems with missing guests on your list. If you decide to add someone at the last moment, you can send them tickets directly via your Eventix dashboard.
