    <p>Facebook is one of the most important channels for marketing today. Most of your visitors have Facebook, and it is an excellent way to reach out to them. If people sign on with their Facebook account to order tickets from Eventix, at your Facebook fan page, exciting developments take place that could benefit you.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Facebook shop<br>
Your Facebook fan page will become a point of sale. Everyone visiting can buy tickets on the same page to avoid any distractions.</li>
    <li>Facebook Auto Attend<br>
With our Auto Attend option, people that visit your shop will automatically be set to ‘interested’ in your Facebook event. If they finalise their payment, they will automatically be set to ‘Going'. This way more people will be attending your Facebook event, showing up in their feeds, reaching out to their friends list about your event. </li>
    <li>Facebook Banner in Shop<br>
While someone orders tickets in your ticket shop your Facebook banner will appear on the same page. Ensuring free likes and exposure for your Facebook fan page and brand.</li>
    <li>Pixels<br>
Eventix has two pixels, for LinkedIn and Facebook. These pixels show you which visitor was redirected from what link. Tracking links is perfect for showing you which visitor is worth retargeting and to what extent, individual, social media posts work.</li>
</ul>
<p>These applications will result in free marketing and further extend the reach of your event.</p>
