      The introduction of Eventix blogs is something we have been working on for quite a while. Next monday, our first official blog will be released. However, I simply could not wait to share this feature with you. So just think of this blog as a teaser for our upcoming content, okay? <br><br>

      So what is the new Facebook feature about?<br><br>

      Well, promoters saw reducing traffic and engagement on Facebook while no one really knew why. After a bunch of updates to the Facebook Platform, our beloved Facebook Event feature received an update. <br><br>

      
For most event promoters, their Facebook Event is the main source of traffic to their ticket shops. This traffic is generated thanks to the ticket shop link shared at the Facebook event. Starting this week, it is possible to add a starting date of  ticket sales to your Facebook Event page.

      Pro Tip: Always use a tracking URL! With a tracking URL, you are able to track clicks, conversions, tickets sold and turnover per link. You can create tracking links in the Eventix dashboard under Tools. <br><br>

      How can you add this new feature to your Facebook event?

<br><br>

      1. Go to your Facebook event or create a new Facebook Event<BR>
2. Go to Event Settings and tickets.<BR>
3.Select custom date and set the start of your tickets sales<BR>

      After you saved your Facebook event settings, you are ready. Everyone who sees your event in their timeline will directly see when ticket sales are starting as seen in the example below.
