    <p>Hello, thank you for the applause and welcome to our first blog. Here we will provide you with the latest and greatest insights while showing you the future of ticketing, event organising and online marketing.<br><br>

Yep, wildly interesting stuff is happening at Eventix. But not many people seem to know.<br><br>

So it is time for a proper introduction. Starting with me, Wesly. Currently working as the copywriter and PR strategist for Eventix while also writing my thesis for graduation. And somehow I still find time to update you through these blogs. Arenâ€™t you lucky?<br><br>

Eventix is a professional, young and exceptionally flexible company. Our team is on top of the newest progressions in ticketing, online marketing and the organising of events. This way, we can provide you with any help you need while letting you enjoy carefree ticketing.<br><br>

As an overenthusiastic intern, I will be your guide. And together, we will brave the depths of big data to the peaks of social media tracking. Especially for you, I will write a new blog every week. <br><br>

Are you as excited as I am?<br><br>

Probably not, but that might change when you read about the topics to come. Think of finding the perfect social media post, how to personalize the bond with your visitors and much, much more.<dr><dr>

Please, let us know what you think, feel, want or need. We love hearing from you guys and the input you provide. <br><br>


Until next time friends,<br><br><br>


Wesly van de Rijdt<br><br>
